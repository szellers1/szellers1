- 👋 Hi, I’m @szellers1
- 👀 I’m interested in Developing new Enterprise Applications in C++
- 🌱 I’m currently implementing a fast Neural Network Simulator and Pattern Recognizer in native C++. It uses no libraries and is 100% hand-coded. You can download the application HERE
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making my code available for research purposes. Also, interested in teaming with a software marketing person for potential commercialization.
- 📫 Please contact me via e-mail to "steven.zellers.name@gmail.com"
